A switch statement is a C# selection statement that provides an alternative to an if-elseif-else branching construct. The switch statement provides advantages over an if-elseif-else construct when evaluating a single value against a list of known matching values.


How does a switch statement work?
    The switch statement chooses one section of code to execute from a list of possible switch sections. The selected switch section is chosen based on a pattern match with the statement's match expression.

    switch (fruit)
{
    case "apple":
        Console.WriteLine($"App will display information for apple.");
        break;

    case "banana":
        Console.WriteLine($"App will display information for banana.");
        break;

    case "cherry":
        Console.WriteLine($"App will display information for cherry.");
        break;
}
