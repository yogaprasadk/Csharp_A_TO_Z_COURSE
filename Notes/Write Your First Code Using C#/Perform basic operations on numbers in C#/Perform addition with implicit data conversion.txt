Add two numeric values:-
    To add two numbers together, you'll use the addition operator, which is the plus symbol +. Yes, the same plus symbol + that you use for string concatenation is also used for addition. The reuse of one symbol for multiple purposes is sometimes called "overloading the operator" and happens frequently in C#.

    int firstNumber = 12;
    int secondNumber = 7;
    Console.WriteLine(firstNumber + secondNumber);

Mix data types to force implicit type conversions:-

    string firstName = "Bob";
    int widgetsSold = 7;
    Console.WriteLine(firstName + " sold " + widgetsSold + " widgets.");

Attempt a more advanced case of adding numbers and concatenating strings

    string firstName = "Bob";
    int widgetsSold = 7;
    Console.WriteLine(firstName + " sold " + widgetsSold + 7 + " widgets.");
    //Instead of adding the int variable widgetsSold to the literal int 7, the compiler treats everything as a string and concatenates it all together.

Add parentheses to clarify your intention to the compiler

    string firstName = "Bob";
    int widgetsSold = 7;
    Console.WriteLine(firstName + " sold " + (widgetsSold + 7) + " widgets.");
