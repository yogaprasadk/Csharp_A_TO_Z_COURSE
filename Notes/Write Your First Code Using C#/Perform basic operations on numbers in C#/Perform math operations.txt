Perform basic math operations
    Write code to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with integers
    int sum = 7 + 5;
    int difference = 7 - 5;
    int product = 7 * 5;
    int quotient = 7 / 5;

    Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
    Console.WriteLine("Difference: " + difference);
    Console.WriteLine("Product: " + product);
    Console.WriteLine("Quotient: " + quotient);

Add code to perform division using literal decimal data.
    decimal decimalQuotient = 7.0m / 5;
    Console.WriteLine($"Decimal quotient: {decimalQuotient}");


Write code to determine the remainder after integer division
    Console.WriteLine($"Modulus of 200 / 5 : {200 % 5}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Modulus of 7 / 5 : {7 % 5}");

Order of operations     

    In math, PEMDAS is an acronym that helps students remember the order of operations. The order is:

    Parentheses (whatever is inside the parenthesis is performed first)
    Exponents
    Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
    Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

    C# follows the same order as PEMDAS except for exponents. While there's no exponent operator in C#, you can use the System.Math.Pow method. The module "Call methods from the .NET Class Library using C#" will feature this method and others.
